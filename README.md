# 🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A simple Snake Game built with Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
Eat the food, grow longer, avoid hitting the walls or yourself.  
Yes, it’s the same game that ate half your childhood.

## 🎮 Features
- Classic snake movement with arrow key controls.
- Food spawns randomly **aligned to the grid** (no half-bite weirdness).
- Score tracking with **persistent high score** saved between runs.
- Increasing difficulty: snake moves faster as you score higher.
- Restart option after game over — no need to relaunch the program.
- Clean modular code: `snake.py`, `food.py`, `scoreboard.py`, `main.py`.
